        The name <em>bonfire</em> comes from the Middle English word
        <em>bonefire</em>, which literally means "a fire of bones". We now
        celebrate around cozy bonfires at night by burning coal or wood to have
        meaningful conversations, watch fireworks, have laughters that echoe
        under the stars, play fun games, and have great food and drinks.

        Bonfires have now become a cool winter tradition recognised worldwide by
        all ethnicities. In my family, we usually have bonfires when celebrating
        weddings or holidays like the new year. Relatives would gather around at
        the end of the ceremony to reminisce and discuss the matters of the day.
        What I enjoy the most is talking about the highlights of the day and
        what we can do better as a family.

        You can also plan a bonfire with your family or friends. If you're on a
        budget...
        <ul>
          <li>Collect branches that have fallen</li>
          <li>Make sure your bonfire is in an open space</li>
          <li>Get blankets and hot drinks for your guests if it gets cold</li>
          <li>Remember to get supervision if you're young.</li>
        </ul>
